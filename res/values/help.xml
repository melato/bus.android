    <string name="help_map">The Map displays one or more routes.
        When you tap on any point on the map,

The <b>Stops</b> screen displays the route stops, in sequence from the start of the route to the end.
The application may highlight a stop of special interest if it is the closest stop to your current location
or if it is the <b>current</b> stop while you are in the route.

The list of stops displays one or two distances.
A distance in parenthesis is a straight line distance from the current location or from a reference location.
A distance with a + or - sign is a <i>route distance</i>, the distance along the route
from a reference location on the route.
The reference route location is the current location, if you are on the route,
or the closest route location to your route location,
or the beginning of the route.
